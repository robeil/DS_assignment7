     * Simulate the operation of a bank. Customers enter the bank, and there is one teller.
     * If the teller is free, that teller serves the customer.
     * Otherwise, the customer enters the queue and waits until the teller is free.
     * Make your program take in a queue of customers and determine the average processing time for the teller.
     * Optional:
     * You make the teller finish with a customer by setting a timer that will count for 15 seconds (Assuming that he took 15 minutes).
     * When the time is up, it should ask for the next customer and serve him/her.
     * You can make the customers just names or create a Customer class
